In 1847 the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a break through discovery: He discovers hand washing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of child bed fever  and by enforcing hand washing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

## Project Objective and Scope
This project was a part of my certification in Data Scientist with Python from DataCamp career path. In this python project I will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected and reevaluate the importance of his discovery.
